<h1> Drawing HTML and the D3 Algorithm </h1>

<p1> In this chapter, Murray goes over what kinds of data there are what can be used as D3. He defines data as "structured information with potential for meaning" which is a very broad definition. He then goes on to say that virtually anything from bytes to archives can be considered data in the programming realm. Specifically, he talkes about four different commands: select, append, text, and style. 
<br> 
Select is used by .select followed by a pair of perentheses. Giving this a CSS selector will return a reference to the first element in the DOM that it couples with. 
<br>
Append is used by .append followed again by a pair of perentheses. This creats a new specified DOM element and tacks it just inside and onto end of the selection it's operating with. It also transfers a reference to said created new element. 
<br> 
Text is used by typing .text followed by a pair of perentheses and this allows for a string to be inserted between the beginning and ending tags of the selection desired.
<br> 
Finally, style is used to set HTML attributed and properties from CSS on selections.
